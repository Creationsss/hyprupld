# IMPORTANT SETUP  
Run the script from your COMMAND LINE first  
- Also do this if it does nothing, it needs to install deps over CLI  

# Launch Arguments  
To change your settings or your auth/api key run the script with `-c`  

# REMEMBER TO CHMOD!!!  
If you want to keybind this remember to do `chmod +x` to it!!  

# SCRIPT USE  
clipboard.sh - copies to clipboard  
guns.lol.sh - for guns.lol  
e-z.gg.sh - for e-z.gg

# AppImage Use  
These are if you want to use the installer script  
They should run the exact same as the scripts  
AppImages are found in the Releases section  
You can compile them yourself with the compile.sh script  
Builds are automatically generated from the latest commit  

# Install Script  
The install script is used to install the scripts to your system  
It will install them to /usr/local/bin  
It will also make the scripts executable and ensure they're in your PATH  
You can either download the repo or the zip for this  
Run `bash install_scripts.sh` to begin the installation process
